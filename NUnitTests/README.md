## NUnit is a unit testing framework for the .NET programming language. It is an open-source project and can be used to test .NET projects of any language, including C#.

### Here is an example of how to use NUnit to test a C# class:

- First, add a reference to the NUnit framework to your project. You can do this using the NuGet package manager in Visual Studio by right-clicking on the project in the Solution Explorer and selecting "Manage NuGet Packages". Search for "NUnit" and install the latest version.

- Create a new class for your unit tests. This class should contain one or more test methods, which are methods that contain the code for your unit tests. Test methods are marked with the [Test] attribute. For example:

```csharp
using NUnit.Framework;

namespace MyProject.Tests
{
    [TestFixture]
    public class MyTests
    {
        [Test]
        public void TestMethod1()
        {
            // Test code goes here
        }
    }
}
```

- In the test method, use the NUnit assertion methods to verify that the code under test is correct. For example:

```csharp
[Test]
public void TestMethod1()
{
    int x = 5;
    int y = 10;
    int expectedResult = 15;

    int actualResult = x + y;

    Assert.AreEqual(expectedResult, actualResult);
}

```
- Run the tests using a test runner. There are several options for test runners, including the built-in test runners in Visual Studio and standalone test runners such as ReSharper and NCrunch.

That's a basic example of how to use NUnit to test a C# class. You can find more detailed documentation and examples on the NUnit website: https://nunit.org/
